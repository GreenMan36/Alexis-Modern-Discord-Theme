# [Alexis Modern Discord Theme](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Alexis%20Modern%20Discord%20Theme)
Based on v21.07.22 with patches from [onkofonko](https://onkofonko.github.io).

This repo just exists for Cumcord and Powercord/Replugged users.
I did not make any of this. I just tried to make it easier to install for these users.
The fixes should auto update thanks to the imports used.

> NOTE THAT V2 OF THE THEME IS IN THE WORKS AND THIS VERSION IS BEING MAINTAINED BY THE COMMUNITY FOR BUG FIXES ONLY.

> PLEASE DO NOT OPEN ANY NEW ISSUES. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, [PLEASE JOIN THE DISCORD SERVER](https://discord.gg/mVDzu73Y26).


Cumcord users can import using: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreenMan36/Alexis-Modern-Discord-Theme/master/theme.css`

Powercord users should clone this repo into their themes folder:
`\replugged\themes`
